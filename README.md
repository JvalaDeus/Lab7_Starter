1) I  would fit my automated tests within a GitHub action that runs whenever code is pushed. This is because the tests will automatically be executed consistently and prevent buggy code from being pushed or merged. It also prevents mistakes with manual testing like forgetting to run tests or overlooking failed results, and avoids the risk of only discovering bugs at the end of development when they are harder to fix.
2) No, I would not use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output?
3) Navigation mode analyzes a page immediately after it loads and evaluates performance metrics like speed and interactivity. Meanwhile the Snapshot mode captures the current state of the page, which is useful for identifying issues with layout and accessibility. However the snapshot mode does not measure JavaScript performance content changes.
4) First suggestion from lighthouse is to properly size the images. Another is to serve images in next-gen formats, and a third suggestion is to preload key images and set the viewport meta tag.
