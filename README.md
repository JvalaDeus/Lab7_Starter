1) I  would fit my automated tests within a GitHub action that runs whenever code is pushed. This is because the tests will automatically be executed consistently and prevent buggy code from being pushed or merged. It also prevents mistakes with manual testing like forgetting to run tests or overlooking failed results, and avoids the risk of only discovering bugs at the end of development when they are harder to fix.
